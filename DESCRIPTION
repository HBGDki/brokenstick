Description: The broken stick model describes a set of individual curves by a linear mixed model using first order linear B-splines. The main use of the model is to align irregularly observed data to a user-specified grid of break ages. A unique feature of this package is that all fitting is done in the Z-score scale, so fitting nonlinearities and irregular data can be treated as separate problems. This package contains functions for fitting a broken stick model to data, for exporting the parameters of the model for independent use outside this package, and for predicting broken stick curves for new data.
