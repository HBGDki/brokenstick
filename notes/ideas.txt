Potential extensions:

1) An impute function that produces multiple imputations according to the fitted broken stick model
2) A vignette that shows how to use the diagnostic for lmer() in the context of the broken stick model
3) A plot function for trajectories that can select ids from a brokenstick object [REALIZED IN V0.44]


Bugs/not so nice parts:
1) predict(exp, x = .., y = ..., subjid = ...) should produce by-subjid estimates. Currently, the system will hang (infinite loop).
